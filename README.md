# ✨ Rachel Gonzalez || @raquel-gonzo ✨

Hi - My name is Rachel and I’m a recent bootcamp grad searching for my first tech role. I’ve been primarily working with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. As a violinist, my goal as a programmer is to make learning music fun!

## Highlighted projects
### 🎻 Violin-app

### 🕉️ Yoga sequence generator
